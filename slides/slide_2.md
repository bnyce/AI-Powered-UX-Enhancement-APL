# Slide 2: Enhancing Accessibility and Clarity with USWDS and AI

## The Role of USWDS in Our Documentation

The United States Web Design System (USWDS) offers a set of recommendations aimed at making government websites more accessible, consistent, and easy to use. While these guidelines are not laws, they are crucial for ensuring that our services are inclusive and accessible to all.

## How AI Complements USWDS

Artificial Intelligence steps in to address areas where guidelines might not provide clear-cut answers, such as:

- **Tone of Language**: AI can analyze and suggest modifications to ensure the language we use is welcoming and easy to understand by a wide audience.
- **Clarity and Brevity**: By rephrasing sentences, AI helps us to convey our messages more clearly and succinctly, adhering to USWDS's emphasis on content that is straightforward and jargon-free.

In essence, AI acts as a bridge between the solid foundation provided by USWDS and the nuanced, often subjective aspects of language that make our documentation truly resonate with users. Together, they help us achieve our goal of making library services more accessible, efficient, and responsive.
