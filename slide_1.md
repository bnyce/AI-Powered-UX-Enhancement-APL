## Innovating Documentation with AI at the Austin Public Library

Good morning, everyone! I'm Bryce Benton, a software engineer with the Austin Public Library. Today, I have the pleasure of sharing an exciting journey we've embarked on: integrating Artificial Intelligence-powered documentation processes with the United States Web Design System (USWDS) and GitHub. Our mission is to enhance the services we provide at the library, making them more accessible, efficient, and responsive to our community's needs.

By leveraging AI, we're not only accelerating the creation of markdown-formatted text documents but also ensuring these materials adhere to the highest standards of clarity, accessibility, and usability, as recommended by the USWDS. Furthermore, our use of GitHub opens up a world of collaboration, allowing us to refine and evolve our documentation through feedback from librarians, patrons, and the broader tech community.

In this presentation, I'll walk you through the ins and outs of our process, from the challenges we've encountered to the innovative solutions we've implemented. Most importantly, I'll highlight how these efforts are making a real difference in making library services more accessible, efficient, and responsive to our community's needs.
