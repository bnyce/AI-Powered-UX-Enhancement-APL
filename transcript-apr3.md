# AI-Powered Documentation: Aligning with US Web Design System and GitHub at the Austin Public Library

## Introduction

- **Speaker:** Bryce Benton, Software Engineer at the Austin Public Library.
- **Experience:** Over 12 years at the Austin Public Library, contributing to the maintenance and extension of the library's website.
- **Presentation Overview:** An exploration of AI-powered documentation within the context of the Austin Public Library, focusing on leveraging the US Web Design System and GitHub to enhance service accessibility and volunteer engagement.

## The Challenge

- **Documentation Gap:** A significant number of library services are either unknown to the public or lack clear instructions for use and maintenance. This gap extends to the code for the website itself, which often lacks comprehensive documentation.
- **Volunteer Engagement:** While many volunteers offer their help, there's a limit to tasks like shelving books. The library seeks deeper engagement opportunities, especially for volunteers with digital skills, which necessitates better documentation.

## The Solution

- **Enhancing Documentation:** Addressing the need for accessible, easy-to-understand documentation to bridge the gap between library services and user understanding.
- **AI Assistance:** Utilizing AI tools, specifically large language models like CHPT or Anthropic's Cloud AI, for generating documentation. This approach not only aids in creating text-based content but also helps in cultivating understanding and answering frequently asked questions.
- **US Web Design System:** Implementing recommendations from the US Web Design System to ensure that digital components and documentation are consistent, accessible, and inclusive.
- **GitHub for Progress Tracking:** Using GitHub as a platform for documenting incremental progress, facilitating collaboration, and storing documentation for easy access and updates.

## Documentation with Markdown

- **Why Markdown?** Explaining the benefits of Markdown for both human readers and machines, given its conciseness and the ease with which AI can generate Markdown-formatted documentation.
- **Application:** Demonstrating the process from AI-generated documentation to its application in GitHub, emphasizing the role of Markdown in creating structured, accessible documents.

## Conclusion

- **Closing Remarks:** Acknowledgment of the ongoing need to understand and apply these tools for better community engagement and service delivery.
- **Invitation for Feedback:** Expressing gratitude for attention and an open call for discussion on project insights and collaborative opportunities.
